<p>Hello, my name's Nick. I'm a direct response copywriter. More on that in a moment. But first...
<p>I’m going to ask you one simple question.</p>
<p><center><span class="bigbold">Do you want your business to make more money?</span></center></p>
<p>I think I know the answer… I’ve got some good news for you.</p>
<p>What if I told you it’s possible to turn $1 into $2, $5, $10, <span class="bigbold">or more?</span> </p>
<p>Would you believe me if I told you your competition is already doing it? </p>
<p>Unless you start doing it too, it's only a matter of time before you are left in the dust.</p>
<p><span class="bigbold">My words make people open their wallets and throw money at whoever I write for.<span class="bigbold"> </p>
<!–– But they aren’t just regular sentences… The words say one thing, but they communicate something completely different. -->
<p>They methodically guide the reader to do exactly what you want.</p>
<!–– I have been extremely fortunate to be trained by the people who dialed in on the best strategies for exactly this. Combined, they have hundreds of years of experience.––>
