Hey there, I’m Nick.

I’m a direct response copywriter, I use my words to make you money. I’m talking doubling, tripling, QUADRUPLING your profit, just with some words and a bit of flair (and a bit of copywriting magic you won’t learn in school). I will tell you more about unlocking hidden profits in your products soon. But first, I will share the purpose of this blog.

I am deeply fascinated by learning new things. But that comes at a price, I can only remember so much at once. If I don’t write it down, it will soon fizzle away to the furthest part of my brain until I revisit that subject.

And that’s a problem. It’s knowledge that you’d benefit from, so instead of keeping you in the dark, I’m going to share it! I do the dirty work of going through articles, videos, seminars, lectures, research journals, scientific papers, and so on... I must be crazy if I do this for fun. But you reap the benefits. What’s in it for me?

That's the real question - <span class="evidence">Why would I do this?</span>

<div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="toleft">

        <p>I benefit from it too. It means I have to take all of my notes, and then boil it down to fit in a blog post. It’s a lot easier to go through notes the size of a blog post instead of a small book. It saves me time, and I don’t have to work as hard in the long run. Now, I'm not saying it's going to feel like you're in school again. The opposite is true. Dense, valuable information and thoughts presented in a way that anyone will love to read. It wouldn't do me any good to write this stuff out if it's boring to read! So, what will actually be on the blog?</p>

        <p>I will cover a wide range of subjects. But, the main subject matter of this blog will be copywriting and technology. It’s what I focus my work on. You'd be surprised at what that <i>actually</i> means.</p>

        <!-- <p> Copywriting is a combination of a bunch of different things. I'm talking about direct response copywriting. The stuff I do. Like getting someone to make a purchase. Sign up for a newsletter. Give out their email. It's a way they <ins>directly respond</ins> to something. Clever, huh? You've probably seen fireworks before, it wouldn't be a fun show if you started with the finale, right? Writing copy isn't all that different.</p> -->

The way copywriting overlaps with everything else is why I am so fascinated with it. You will be too. I won't go too deep into it, but copywriting utilizes the flaws and quirks of human psychology. That's a pretty darned broad subject. We've got things like...
- What makes someone buy something, even if they don't think they *need* it.
- How to get someone to say 'YES!' (This one is terrifying. You'll see exactly why.)
- What makes someone **start** reading.
- How to keep someone glued to the words until its over, and have them begging for more.

I could go on forever with this list. I told you, there's a lot of stuff here. Humans are funny. The problem is we're easily manipulated. I am trusting you that you'll use this stuff for good, not evil. Take a can of pop (or soda). Open it. You pull the tab of that ice cold can, and the most satisfying sound echoes through the room. It makes you want one. It makes everyone else want one. It's not by accident.

The same applies to copywriting. It's not by accident, every word is chosen for a reason. Once I show you the fascinating world of copywriting, psychology, and technology... You won't be able to un-see it. Again, I am trusting that you will use this information responsibly. It happens all around us, and most of the time it goes unnoticed.

*P.S. Pretty soon I'll get around to having notifications for my new posts. When I do, you won't want to miss out. I'll change this once I get there. My free time right now is spent mostly building content to share with you. I'll get to the notifications soon enough.*
