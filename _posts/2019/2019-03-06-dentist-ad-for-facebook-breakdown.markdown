First, before we post an ad, we need to understand some things. What objective the ad should accomplish and who we’re going to show the ad to. Dentist ads are a tricky lot. Who should we target? How many people? What interests? Look-alike audiences? Income? The list can go on forever.

Our objective is to get people in the door of the dentist office, and keep them coming back. The ads can only get people in the door, the dentist office is what controls the experience once they're there. In the case that a client does not return, we can always retarget them with different ads to get them back. This retargeting tactic is extremely effective.

People aren’t going to drive from Alberta to our dentist office here in Ontario. Ignore what the gurus have said about targeting millions of people at once, we have to think logically. We're not after millions of people across the country!

We know our potential clients are in our area. Do we just target everyone in the local area? Well, sure, but it wouldn’t be optimal. Let’s think about what we’re offering in our promotion. The offer is free teeth whitening. We can start it off by selecting everyone in the area interested in “Teeth Whitening.”

That was easy, right? Well, we’re not quite finished yet. There’s a lot of people who are interested in teeth whitening but are not a potential client. We have to narrow it down. Simply put, we have to exclude everyone who works in the dental field. Think about it, another dentist who offers teeth whitening would not be a good potential client for us.

When we think about it further, getting a 400 dollar teeth whitening for free is a darned good deal. So good that someone might drive an hour or more for it, but never come back. They offer no lifetime value for us, so we continue to narrow the geographic area down to the exact areas that will offer the most value for us in the long run.

We can use things like censuses, income reports, and more to understand who and were we want to target. Someone who wants whiter teeth, but doesn’t have the money or insurance to afford to go to the dentist is targeted differently than someone who can. Someone who currently doesn't have the funds for regular visits will be more likely to go after referral incentives. Let's dig deeper on lifetime value and referrals.

But, even with the best targeting, it won’t always be right. Fellow marketers have found that a dental patient has a lifetime value of around $5000. Even if we spent $50 a day on advertising for a month, getting only one new client would be profitable! Of course, we are aiming for better results, but this illustrates the cushion of protection we have when the lifetime value of a customer increases.

That’s just a drop in the bucket when we look at potential revenue. People trust their friends over a Facebook ad. With such high lifetime value, it’s important to run promotions for referrals. Make the incentives HUGE. <span class="evidence">With just three referrals the lifetime value is now $20,000!</span> Now, our client who got a free teeth whitening, but couldn't afford to visit regularly without referring friends is worth so much more to us financially.

Now that we’ve established customer targeting and the lifetime value, Let’s break the ads down and see the reasoning behind the decisions.

# Let's start with the first ad.

### 1. Body Copy
- I started the copy off with emojis. There's a lot of debate over the use of them, but I've seen the results. Emojis help with engagement, clickthrough rates, and more. HubSpot studied over 19 MILLION posts across multiple social platforms. They concluded that from a marketing standpoint, emojis are undeniably useful.
- The siren and warning sign get the reader in a frame of mind that whatever they're about to read is extremely important. "EXCLUSIVE LIMITED TIME FREE OFFER." The prestige that comes with having something exclusive is one of our **physiological needs**.  It's not just exclusive, it's only there for a limited time. If that's not enough, it's also free.
- "Getting a white smile is hard, brushing just isn't enough." People don't like things that are hard. We want an easy solution. People are much more likely to search for a cure rather than prevention. The reader realizes it's hard, and what they're doing will **never** get them the smile they want.
- "With a new breakthrough in teeth whitening..." People **love** breakthroughs. If it's a brand new breakthrough, other people probably haven't done it yet. Why do people buy new phones every year when not much has changed? Because it's new and no one else has it.
- "...Tall Oaks can turn even the most yellow teeth into bright white." This line is the most powerful in the ad. Up until this point, someone could dismiss the ad because their teeth are *extremely* yellow that no whitening can help them. By saying we can help even the most yellow teeth, it gives them hope. No matter how bad we are, we never think we're the absolute worst. In just a few words we turn any skeptics into believers.
- "In as little as 30 minutes." As great as everything sounds so far, no one will do it if it takes days, weeks, or even months. People like push-button solutions. People want things fixed easily and fast.


### 2. Image
- Dentist offices can be unhappy places for people. We use an image of a smiling woman to associate Tall Oaks with happy clients.
- A monochromatic background makes the model stand out more.
- She has a visible white smile, showing exactly what Tall Oaks can do. We create a mental image for the reader that they will be in the model's position.


### 3. Offer
- It says exactly what the offer is.
- $399 is visible but crossed out. Readers will see exactly how much money they're saving by taking up this offer. Free is written in larger font to pop out.
- We use a hand-written font for the strikeout, "FREE", and underline. This gives the ad a personal feel.
- Darkening and blurring the area around the offer makes it stand out much more.
- Using a small number of colours keeps the focus where we want it. The model's skin tone and the blue "FREE" both contrast nicely against the backgrounds.


### 4. Headline
- Fits all the information we need into the small space.
- The use of periods to fragment sentences causes the reader to stop and consciously think about the words.
- States exactly what the offer is.


### 5. Button
- "Get Offer" tells the reader that it's an offer, and they need to click it NOW if they want to get it.

# Now for the second ad.

### 1. Body Copy

- Much shorter than the first ad. Again, we use emojis to improve metrics. The tooth emoji is associated with dentistry and gives a friendlier feel. The choice of emoji we use depends on split tests.
- "Newest and Safest Teeth Whitening For Free" People like new things, they like safe things, they like free things. This is for people who are seeking teeth whitening or understand the problem. Depending on how aware an audience is, we change how we offer a solution. Like in the first ad, we "stirred the pot" and told the reader they can't get a white smile by brushing.
- "Celebrity Quality Smiles in as Little as 30 Minutes." What is a celebrity quality smile? I don't know, but if I can get the same smile as a Hollywood celebrity, I want it! But wait, it could be as little as 30 minutes to look like a celebrity? I want it even more!
- "Click to Book Now (Limited Time Only)" Tells the reader what to do, and to do it fast. It won't last forever.

### 2. Offer

- "FREE" dominates the ad, helping to grab readers attention.
- White font contrasts nicely against the background, optimized for readability.
- I used a few typographic skills to stack the words. Studies have shown that typographic style techniques improve a readers perception of a brand or message.
- Like in the first ad, the offer says exactly what it is.

### 3. Image

- Originally, the photo was a different colour, but with a bit of Photoshop magic, we can give the ad any look and feel we want. I went with a pink colour for two reasons. The pink contrasts great against the model's hair and shirt. Facebook is heavily dominated by the colour blue, so using a contrasting colour helps us to stand out.
- Like the first ad, we have a smiling woman. She's happy with her new smile from Tall Oaks, and the reader will be as well. This is just some basic psychology, but effective. Make the reader see themselves as better when they use our products or services.
- What's better, the model on the right or the left? There's no answer unless we split test it. I chose the right to start with because, in my research, more ads follow the same layout. Research is a good starting point.

### 4. Headline

- Fear of missing out (FOMO) is one of the most powerful selling techniques. We're telling the reader that they don't want to miss out on this.
- We can't assume the reader will read every word in the ad, but if they do, this headline helps even more. We've already established they can have a "celebrity smile" in 30 minutes, and that it's a limited time offer. The headline now reinforces that they do NOT want to miss out on this.

### 5. Button
- Like the first ad, "Get Offer" tells the reader that it's an offer, and they need to click it NOW if they want to get it. With the added FOMO from the headline, it will help get more clicks.

**As you can see, the ads are much more than they appear. There are so many things we can change and test, such as using a male model rather than female. Changing the fonts, colours, and wording. Even with the same basic elements, we can continuously strive to make the most effective ads.**
