In this writeup we discuss two real estate ads. Both ads are designed to get readers contact information and down the road turn them into paying customers. Both ads target different audiences, but their end goal is the same. Pretty simple, right? But how do we get that contact information?

We have to exchange something for it. No reader will give us their information unless they feel like they’re going to benefit from it. This is what lead magnets are. We provide something the reader finds valuable in exchange for their contact information.

Remember, in time we will turn these lists of contacts into paying customers.

Most people buying homes in this area are already locals. We will keep the ads local, too.

With that in mind, let’s look at the ads!

# Our First Ad

This ad is for people who are conscious about the value of their home. Not necessarily buying or selling a home yet, but will be down the road.

### Body Copy

We start the body copy off by calling out people already owning homes. This is because it's easier to sell a home to someone who's already been through the process of buying a home. If we aimed it at renters, we would have to educate them at some point down the road on why they should be owning rather than renting. We would group renters in a separate funnel than owners.

A study done by the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals claims the average Canadian will own 4-6 homes in their lifetime. It's in the homeowners best interest to want to increase the value of their home. Knowing this, we tell them they can increase the value of their home by up to 50%. Now that will grab someone's attention.

We know people will be skeptical of us. People will say they can't afford to make the changes. The line "Without Breaking The Bank" preemptively answers the skeptics. The reader can't have any reason to scroll past us after reading our post.

Next we get right to the point and tell the reader to click the image to learn more.

### Image

We used a beautiful yet realistic looking interior. We want to create an image in the readers mind that they can get that dream home with our help. Visual imagery is really powerful.

The blurred blue bar with white text is contrasting and visually pleasing. We chose a serif font to give a more professional feel to the ad.

### The Rest

If the reader reads nothing but the headline, they will still understand what the ad is about. "Your Home Will Shine With These 7 Hacks!" The word hack is one that people have pretty strong opinions over. Some say it's overused, some say it's cliché. But results speak for themselves, and if using a word like "Tips" outperforms it, then we will change it.

A simple "Learn More" button is all we need for this ad.

# Our Second Ad

### Body Copy

This ad will show up for people interested in buying a new home. By telling them right away that it has 6 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms, only good leads will continue with us. Someone buying a 1 bedroom apartment will not continue through our funnel.


The line "Click Below for Price, Location + More Pics!" is really important here. In advertising we have something called "above the fold." It originates from print advertising, it's the portion of the paper the reader can see before unfolding it.

In our case, the "fold" is the "see more" button. People may not click it. Lengthy text drives people away from things. Right away we tell them to just click for more information. They don't even have to read the full ad to learn more.

Those who do want to continue reading will learn more about the home. We mention things that help homes sell and increase value. The "+ MUCH MORE" builds curiosity. What else does this magical home have?

If that wasn't enough we throw in that it's an extremely rare opportunity. If they weren't sold yet, they definitely are now.

We re-iterate to the reader to click below for more info. We don't want them to forget why they're reading the ad!

### Image

We use a gorgeous photo of the home that we're selling. We could do an album or video, but in this case we want the reader to click the ad to see more images.

We could add text, but we want the focus to be on the gorgeous home.

### The Rest

The headline and description here are for people who don't read the body copy, and skim the headline. What exactly does "Fully Loaded" mean? They'll have to click through to find out.
