Hey there, I’m Nick.

I’m a direct response copywriter, I use my words to make you money. I’m talking doubling, tripling, QUADRUPLING your profit, just with some words and a bit of flair (and a bit of copywriting magic you won’t learn in school). I will tell you more about unlocking the hidden potential in your business soon. But first, I will share the purpose of this blog.

I am deeply fascinated by learning new things. I began learning about copywriting and I immediately was hooked. Growing up I had the habit of learning a subject, getting burnt out, and moving on to something new. For some reason, copywriting was different. It just stuck. Don’t get me wrong, I still very much enjoy learning new things! But I can continuously read and practice writing copy, but I just don’t get burnt out.

I owe it to friendly folks online who share their knowledge with me. No matter the subject, there’s always free resources out there to learn from. Without the generosity of strangers over the internet, almost everything I have learned wouldn’t have been possible.

Especially the copywriting community. I still remember Googling what copywriting was, sending some emails and messages out and hoping for a response. The people I emailed were making high 6-figure salaries, some even 7-figure salaries. I hoped for the best but expected no responses. To my delight, every person I contacted responded. That was when I started seeing the copywriting community as a bit different.

Here’s a guy who made almost 1.5 million dollars last year spending his evenings emailing me. In one hour, he made as much as I did a week working full time right out of high school. He wasn’t getting anything from me in return, <span class="evidence">so why was he being so generous?</span>

    <div class="toleft">

        <p>The exact same reason I am making this blog. It was the kindness of strangers (specifically the copywriting community) that helped him get to where he is today. It was his way of giving back.</p>

        <p>This blog is my way of giving back. It would be an injustice to you if I did not share what I have learned.</p>

        <p>The blog will cover a wide range of subjects. I like lots of things! But the main subject matter will be copywriting and advertising. Pretty specific blog, right? Wrong! You'd be surprised at what it <i>actually</i> means.</p>

        <!-- <p> Copywriting is a combination of a bunch of different things. I'm talking about direct response copywriting. The stuff I do. Like getting someone to make a purchase. Sign up for a newsletter. Give out their email. It's a way they <ins>directly respond</ins> to something. Clever, huh? You've probably seen fireworks before, it wouldn't be a fun show if you started with the finale, right? Writing copy isn't all that different.</p> -->

The way copywriting overlaps with everything else is why I am so fascinated with it. You will be too. I won't go too deep into it yet, but copywriting utilizes the flaws and quirks of human psychology. That's a darned broad subject. We've got things like...

- What makes someone buy something, even if they don't think they *need* it.
- How to get someone to say 'YES!' to buy your product or service. (This one is fascinating!)
- What makes someone **start** reading.
- How to keep someone’s eyes glued to the words until its over and have them begging for more.

I could go on forever with this list. I told you, there's a lot of stuff here. Humans are funny. The problem is we're easily manipulated (most of the time we don’t even know it’s happening!).

Don’t believe me? Take a can of Coke.  Open it. You pull the tab of that ice cold can, and the most distinct and satisfying sound echoes through the room. You know you’re about to experience something that feels good. It makes everyone else want one. This is no accident.

The same applies to copywriting. It's not by accident, every word is chosen for a reason. Once I show you the fascinating world of copywriting, psychology, and advertising... You won't be able to un-see it. Again, I am trusting that you will use this information responsibly. It happens all around us, and most of the time it goes unnoticed.

I can’t wait to share more with you, I know some of you will fall in love with this stuff just like I did.
