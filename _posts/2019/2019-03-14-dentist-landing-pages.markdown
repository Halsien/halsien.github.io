Landing pages are extremely effective at lowering customer acquisition cost, and improving conversion rates. Yet, I hear objections to them like the following.

"What's the point of a landing page? I have a perfectly fine website!"

This is a common (and understandable) objection. To best answer this, let's go over why we run ads in the first place!

Our goal when running ads is to get the user to take action. Whether it's buying something, booking an appointment, or giving us their email. No matter what it is, we want the user to <strong><u>take action</u></strong>. The page we end up on has a huge impact on what we do. Let me explain...

Going to any business's website we have a bunch of links, pictures, words... <span class="evidence">**distractions**</span>.

Landing pages lack all of these distractions. By keeping it simple, we guide users to converting. We keep their focus on the objective. We set up the pages to get them to take action.

Let's dive into two landing pages I made.

These are for a brick-and-mortar business. The first landing page only says what the offer is, where to get it, and how to get it. Something to note is the landing page says the same thing as the ad, we want the offer to match throughout the funnel.

We smack the user in the face with giant buttons to claim the offer. If a user is ready to claim the offer, we don't want them to miss it.

The second landing page is more complex. It has much more information about the dentist, and the call to action is different. Instead of claiming the teeth whitening, it's asking the user to view openings and book a spot. A friendlier, more inviting feel to it.

A dentist can be a big commitment for people, the second landing page starts to build a relationship right away.

If you would like to visit the landing page examples, click the links above. These are just mockups, so the links and buttons on them don't navigate you to where they would in a real landing page.

<i>Side Note: I included an interactive Google map in the landing pages. I've seen it done a lot with landing pages that require visiting a physical location. I'd like to try just a photo of a map, or even just an address for a dentist office landing page. I'd like to compare and record the results of those split tests some time.</i>

<h2>What landing page is better?</h2>

Generally, the more simple an offer or product is, the more simple the landing page. When it requires information about it, landing pages become more information-dense.

In this case, with a dentist office both simple and complex may work. These would need to be split tested against each other to see what works better, and with what type of audience.
