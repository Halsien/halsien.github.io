These are some ads for a dentist office. Two of the previews are what the ads would look like in someone's Facebook newsfeed.


Every element in each ad is there to help the ad perform better. During a campaign, we will constantly change, tweak, and test different elements to get a better return on adspend (ROAS), meaning every dollar spent on the ads generates more revenue.

Let's break them down and see the reasoning behind the decisions.

# Let's start with the first ad.

### 1. Body Copy
- I started the copy off with emojis. There's a lot of debate over the use of them, but I've seen the results. Emojis help with engagement, clickthrough rates, and more. HubSpot studied over 19 MILLION posts across multiple social platforms. They concluded that from a marketing standpoint, emojis are undeniably useful.
- The siren and warning sign get the reader in a frame of mind that whatever they're about to read is extremely important. "EXCLUSIVE LIMITED TIME FREE OFFER." The prestige that comes with having something exclusive is one of our **physiological needs**.  It's not just exclusive, it's only there for a limited time. If that's not enough, it's also free.
- "Getting a white smile is hard, brushing just isn't enough." People don't like things that are hard. We want an easy solution. People are much more likely to search for a cure rather than prevention. The reader realizes it's hard, and what they're doing will **never** get them the smile they want.
- "With a new breakthrough in teeth whitening..." People **love** breakthroughs. If it's a brand new breakthrough, other people probably haven't done it yet. Why do people buy new phones every year when not much has changed? Because it's new and no one else has it.
- "...Tall Oaks can turn even the most yellow teeth into bright white." This line is the most powerful in the ad. Up until this point, someone could dismiss the ad because their teeth are *extremely* yellow that no whitening can help them. By saying we can help even the most yellow teeth, it gives them hope. No matter how bad we are, we never think we're the absolute worst. In just a few words we turn any skeptics into believers.
- "In as little as 30 minutes." As great as everything sounds so far, no one will do it if it takes days, weeks, or even months. People like push-button solutions. People want things fixed easily and fast.


### 2. Image
- Dentist offices can be unhappy places for people. We use an image of a smiling woman to associate Tall Oaks with happy clients.
- A monochromatic background makes the model stand out more.
- She has a visible white smile, showing exactly what Tall Oaks can do. We create a mental image for the reader that they will be in the model's position.


### 3. Offer
- It says exactly what the offer is.
- $399 is visible but crossed out. Readers will see exactly how much money they're saving by taking up this offer. Free is written in larger font to pop out.
- We use a hand-written font for the strikeout, "FREE", and underline. This gives the ad a personal feel.
- Darkening and blurring the area around the offer makes it stand out much more.
- Using a small number of colours keeps the focus where we want it. The model's skin tone and the blue "FREE" both contrast nicely against the backgrounds.


### 4. Headline
- Fits all the information we need into the small space.
- The use of periods to fragment sentences causes the reader to stop and consciously think about the words.
- States exactly what the offer is.


### 5. Button
- "Get Offer" tells the reader that it's an offer, and they need to click it NOW if they want to get it.

# Now for the second ad.

### 1. Body Copy

- Much shorter than the first ad. Again, we use emojis to improve metrics. The tooth emoji is associated with dentistry and gives a friendlier feel. The choice of emoji we use depends on split tests.
- "Newest and Safest Teeth Whitening For Free" People like new things, they like safe things, they like free things. This is for people who are seeking teeth whitening or understand the problem. Depending on how aware an audience is, we change how we offer a solution. Like in the first ad, we "stirred the pot" and told the reader they can't get a white smile by brushing.
- "Celebrity Quality Smiles in as Little as 30 Minutes." What is a celebrity quality smile? I don't know, but if I can get the same smile as a Hollywood celebrity, I want it! But wait, it could be as little as 30 minutes to look like a celebrity? I want it even more!
- "Click to Book Now (Limited Time Only)" Tells the reader what to do, and to do it fast. It won't last forever.

### 2. Offer

- "FREE" dominates the ad, helping to grab readers attention.
- White font contrasts nicely against the background, optimized for readability.
- I used a few typographic skills to stack the words. Studies have shown that typographic style techniques improve a readers perception of a brand or message.
- Like in the first ad, the offer says exactly what it is.

### 3. Image

- Originally, the photo was a different colour, but with a bit of Photoshop magic, we can give the ad any look and feel we want. I went with a pink colour for two reasons. The pink contrasts great against the model's hair and shirt. Facebook is heavily dominated by the colour blue, so using a contrasting colour helps us to stand out.
- Like the first ad, we have a smiling woman. She's happy with her new smile from Tall Oaks, and the reader will be as well. This is just some basic psychology, but effective. Make the reader see themselves as better when they use our products or services.
- What's better, the model on the right or the left? There's no answer unless we split test it. I chose the right to start with because, in my research, more ads follow the same layout. Research is a good starting point.

### 4. Headline

- Fear of missing out (FOMO) is one of the most powerful selling techniques. We're telling the reader that they don't want to miss out on this.
- We can't assume the reader will read every word in the ad, but if they do, this headline helps even more. We've already established they can have a "celebrity smile" in 30 minutes, and that it's a limited time offer. The headline now reinforces that they do NOT want to miss out on this.

### 5. Button
- Like the first ad, "Get Offer" tells the reader that it's an offer, and they need to click it NOW if they want to get it. With the added FOMO from the headline, it will help get more clicks.

**As you can see, the ads are much more than they appear. There are so many things we can change and test, such as using a male model rather than female. Changing the fonts, colours, and wording. Even with the same basic elements, we can continuously strive to make the most effective ads.**
