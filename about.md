<h1 class="heading-27">What I Do</h1>
<p>I produce marketing campaigns that are driven by measurable data. This removes the guesswork and ensures <strong>better return on investment.</strong></p>

<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:black; padding: 2px; font-weight: 600; width: auto; color: black; background: #eeeeee; display: block; text-align: center;">I am here to generate more revenue for your business. Improving your marketing results with cold, hard data.</p>

<p>There are other marketing professionals who focus on pretty branding and fluff, telling you it will help you sell. To be blunt, it's like pissing in the wind. I write and advertise with metrics, not hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>I've met a lot of business owners looking to generate more revenue. Not one of them chose a losing marketing campaign over one that generates piles of cash.</p>

<p>While I have professional experience in graphic design, the artistic elements do not control the marketing. If it is between design and results... choose results.</p>

<p>A/B or "split testing" is something I do constantly. Whatever marketing campaign I work on I am testing multiple variations. Something as tiny as changing the colour of a word could be the factor in a good campaign and a great campaign. Don't let those small details get overlooked by the other guys. They're in it for a quick buck and will settle for a <strong>barely</strong> profitable campaign.</p>

<p>My doors are always open, if you're in the Niagara region we can grab a cup of coffee some time and talk face to face on taking your business to the next level.</p>
